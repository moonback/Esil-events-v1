- Admin interfaces generally use `@components/layouts/AdminLayout.tsx`.
- `@components/admin/AdminHeader.tsx` is a common header for admin sections.
- Admin notifications use `@components/admin/AdminNotification.tsx` and `NotificationContainer`.
- Statistical data is often displayed using `@components/admin/StatCard.tsx` (the newer one from `components/StatCard.tsx` seems to be the intended one for general admin stats, while `components/admin/StatCard.tsx` is the one with specific color schemes and trend lines).
- Admin routes are protected by `@components/AdminRoute.tsx`.
- Forms in the admin section (e.g., `@components/ProductForm.tsx`) handle data for entities like products, categories.
- Product form uses dynamic categories from `@services/categoryService.ts` and supports image uploads.
- Tools like `KeywordGeneratorTool` and `KeywordRankingTool` provide SEO functionalities.

- Quote request management includes components like `QuoteRequestList`, `QuoteRequestDetails`, `AIResponseGenerator`, `FilterPanel`, `Pagination` found in `components/admin/quoteRequests/`.
