- The cart functionality is managed by `@context/CartContext.tsx`.
- `CartPage.tsx` orchestrates the cart display and checkout process.
- Key cart components in `components/cart/`:
    - `CartItemList.tsx`: Displays items in the cart.
    - `CartSummary.tsx`: Shows cart total and checkout button.
    - `EmptyCart.tsx`: Displayed when the cart is empty.
    - `CheckoutForm.tsx`: Collects user and event details for a quote request. Uses `FormData` type from `components/cart/types.ts`.
    - `CartSummaryPreview.tsx`: Shows a preview of cart items within the checkout form.
    - `SuccessMessage.tsx`: Displayed after successful quote submission.

- Submitting the `CheckoutForm` triggers `createQuoteRequest` from `@services/quoteRequestService.ts`.
