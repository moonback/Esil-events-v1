- This project is a React application built with TypeScript.
- Styling is primarily done using Tailwind CSS. Custom global styles and animations can be found in `index.css` and the `styles/` directory (e.g., `header-animations.css`, `admin-animations.css`, `map.css`).
- Custom fonts used: 'Komoda' and 'Code Pro' (defined in `index.css`).
- State management for cart and product comparison is handled via React Context:
    - `@context/CartContext.tsx`
    - `@context/ComparisonContext.tsx`
- Routing is managed by `react-router-dom`. Main routes are in `App.tsx`. Admin routes are in `components/AdminRoutes.tsx`.
- Supabase is used as the backend and database. Client is configured in `@services/supabaseClient.ts`.
- SEO is managed by the `@components/SEO.tsx` component, with default configurations in `@config/seo.ts`.
- Email services (SMTP configuration, sending emails) are handled by `@services/emailService.ts`. SMTP config is initialized at app startup in `App.tsx`.
- Cookie consent is managed by `@components/CookieConsent.tsx` using the `@hooks/useCookieConsent.ts` hook.
- Lucide Icons (`lucide-react`) are used extensively for iconography.

- Framer Motion (`framer-motion`) is used for animations.
